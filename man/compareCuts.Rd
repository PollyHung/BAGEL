\title{Compare User Provided Breakpoint to Reference Used}
\usage{
compareCuts(reference, breakpoint, filename)
}
\arguments{
\item{reference}{A dataframe containing reference breakpoint data, including columns such as
'arm', 'telcent', 'direction', and other relevant metrics.}

\item{breakpoint}{A dataframe containing cut breakpoint data with a similar structure to 'reference'.}

\item{filename}{A string representing the directory path where the summary results will be saved as a CSV file.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing merged data with calculated overlap metrics and deviation scores.
}
\description{
This function compares two dataframes of breakpoint data, merging them to calculate
overlap metrics based on the overlap between reference and cut breakpoints.
}
\details{
The function creates unique identifiers for each row based on arm, telcent, and direction.
It computes overlap metrics between the reference and cut breakpoints and calculates
a combined overlap score that reflects the degree of overlap.
A warning is issued if any breakpoints do not overlap.

\examples{
merged_data <- compareCuts(reference_data, cuts_data, "path/to/output")
