\title{Join Segments Based on Alteration Type}
\usage{
joinSegs(
  segments,
  aneu,
  coord = coordinates,
  ncutoff = cutoff,
  telcent,
  integer = FALSE,
  TELCENT
)
}
\arguments{
\item{segments}{A dataframe containing segment information with columns for \code{Sample}, \code{Chromosome},
\code{Start}, \code{End}, \code{Segment_Mean}, and other relevant attributes.}

\item{aneu}{A character string indicating the alteration type. Options are "amp", "del", "non-del", and "non-amp".}

\item{coord}{A numeric vector of length 4 representing the coordinates of the chromosome arms.}

\item{ncutoff}{A numeric cutoff value used to classify segments based on their \code{Segment_Mean}.}

\item{telcent}{A character string indicating whether to check for 'telomere' or 'centromere' alignment.}

\item{integer}{A logical value indicating whether to return integer lengths or normalized percentages.}

\item{TELCENT}{An additional parameter related to telomere/centromere classification (specific usage not defined).}
}
\value{
A dataframe summarizing the joined segments, including columns for \code{Sample}, \code{percent},
\code{start}, and \code{end}.
}
\description{
This function processes genomic segments based on their alteration type (e.g., amplification or deletion),
joining adjacent segments if the gap between them is less than their combined lengths. It also checks
for telomere and centromere alignment based on specific coordinates.

\examples{
# Example usage
result <- joinSegs(segments, aneu = "amp", coord = c(1, 100, 200, 300),
                   ncutoff = 0.5, telcent = "tel", integer = FALSE, TELCENT)
