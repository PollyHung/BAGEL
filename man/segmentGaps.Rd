\title{Calculate Segment Gaps}
\usage{
segmentGaps(segments, genome = "hg38")
}
\arguments{
\item{segments}{A data frame containing segment information with columns:
\itemize{
\item Sample: Identifier for the sample
\item Chromosome: Chromosome number
\item Arm: Chromosome arm
\item Start: Start position of the segment
\item End: End position of the segment
}}
}
\value{
A data frame containing:
\itemize{
\item gap_length: Total gaps for each sample
\item sequenced_seg_length: Total length of sequenced segments
\item total_seg_length: Combined length of gaps and sequenced segments
\item sequence_coverage: Proportion of the arm length that is covered
\item coverage: Proportion of sequenced length to total segment length
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the total gaps between segments for each sample,
as well as gaps grouped by chromosome and by arm. Gaps in segmentation files
can arise from technical issues, such as low probe density, or biological
factors where regions may have normal copy numbers. The variability in gap sizes
can impact downstream analyses, particularly when comparing segment means or
aberrations. This function helps assess the coverage differences, which may
warrant correction to ensure reliable comparisons.
