\title{Calculate Percentage of Altered Segments per Chromosomal Arm}
\usage{
percentCoverage(
  segments,
  gaps,
  amp_thres = 0.1,
  del_thres = -0.1,
  noise = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{segments}{A dataframe containing segmentation data. Must include columns:
Sample, Arm, Start, End, Log2Ratios}

\item{gaps}{A dataframe containing coverage information from segmentGaps function. Must include columns:
Sample, Arm, gap_length, sequenced_seg_length, total_seg_length, arm_length}

\item{noise}{Optional dataframe containing noise-based thresholds (not currently implemented)}

\item{thres}{Numeric threshold for amplification/deletion calling. If NULL, uses noise-based thresholds.
(default = 0.1)}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing:
\itemize{
\item Original segmentation data with coverage metrics
\item aneuploid column indicating alteration status ("amplification", "deletion", or "no_change")
\item Calculated coverage metrics: seg_length, net_seg_coverage, seg_coverage
}
}
\description{
This function computes the percentage of amplified or deleted segments in each chromosomal arm
based on log2 ratios and coverage metrics. Supports both fixed thresholds and noise-based thresholds.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Using hard threshold
data(segments)
data(gaps)
results <- percentAlt(segments, gaps, thres = 0.15)

# Using noise threshold (requires implementation)
data(noise_data)
results <- percentAlt(segments, gaps, thres = NULL, noise = noise_data)
}
